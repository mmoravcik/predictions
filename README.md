Predictions
===========

My first Django app I used to learn this Framework
Created for my company to play sport predictions game every week.
Predict (football) games to earn points.

Looking back
------------
2 years later..looking back..found lots of stuff to sort out:

* use django forms instead of custom ones
* use class based views
* use URL tag not hardcoded urls
* don't abuse ORM, hit database less
* user profile
* tests are messy (but at least they are)
* PEP8
* and more...

That feeling when you look at your old code...
